## Introduction üöÄ
In today's cybersecurity landscape, Security Operations Centers (SOCs) play a vital role in safeguarding organizations against threats. This repository aims to empower SOC teams with robust Python modules designed to streamline security operations and bolster incident response efforts.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
To get started with SOC Modules for Python, follow these simple installation steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/soc-modules-python.git
   cd soc-modules-python
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
Usage üñ•Ô∏è
Once installed, you can leverage the SOC modules by importing them into your Python scripts. Here's a quick example of how to use a module
```bash
from soc_modules import paramiko_module, requests_module, pyshark_module, scapy_module
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Utilize module functions or classes
result = paramiko_module.connect(host='hostname', username='user', password='pass')
response = requests_module.get('https://api.github.com/events')
capture = pyshark_module.LiveCapture(interface='eth0')
packet = scapy_module.IP(dst='www.google.com')/scapy_module.ICMP()
```
replace module_name with the actual module name and function_name with the specific function or class you wish to use.

## Features üåü
